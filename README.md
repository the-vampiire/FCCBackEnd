## [<a href="https://vampiire-timestamp.herokuapp.com/">Project Link</a>] TimeStamp Microservice Project, User Stories:

* I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).

* If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.

* If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.

## [<a href="https://vampiire-tinyurl.herokuapp.com/">Project Link</a>] URL Shortener, User Stories:

* I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response [URL in input box]

* If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid http://www.example.com format, the JSON response will contain an error instead[I will be notified if my URL is invalid and will be unable to submit it until it has been corrected]

* When I visit that shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link
